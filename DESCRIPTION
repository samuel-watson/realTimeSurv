Description: Convenient tools and data for the real-time surveillance of 
    infectious disease and various visualisation and reporting tools. 
    The package serves as a wrapper to a variety of geostatistical (lgcp, sp, rgeos, etc.) 
    and plotting packages (ggplot2, ggmap, ggspatial, etc. ) for R, and is intended to 
    enable rapid deployment of real-time surveillance statistical software.
